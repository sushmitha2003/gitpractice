git commands

"local repository to remote repository"

 step1: checker whether the directory is required directory
 step2: git init
 step3: git add .
 step4: git commit -m "comment"
 now the files moved into local repository 
 step5: now the files in the local repository should be moved to remote repository
 that is  git remote add origin first link in github
 step6: git push -u origin branch(master)

"stages of git"
three stages in git 
.modified  (after initilisation the files are untracked (u) once if it is added to local repo then any changes are made to exsisting files then files are modified(m))
.staged (after modifying the files the files should be added to staging area )
.commited (then commit the changes to local repo .git directory)
(the push the changes to remote repo)

"branching"
git branch - to check the exsisting branches
git branch branchname - to create a branch
git checkout branchname - to switch branch
git switch branchname - to switch branch
git checkout -b branchname - to create and switch to that branch
git merge branchname - to merge branches (for doing this first we need to move to root branch and merge)

 branch are two types
 .fastforward merge (just merge)
 .two way/recursive merge  (first we need to make changes in one branch one file then add and commit and the make changes in another branch same file and then add commit and then merge both the branches)
 And then add commit push 
 conflict occurs then select the line you want (in case for comparision no need to add and commit) else add and commit. and then push to remote repo.

clone
.git clone githublink - to clone
